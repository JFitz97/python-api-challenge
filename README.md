# python-api-challenge
This challenge was broken up into two segments. In the first, WeatherPy I analyzed weather data from over 500 cities throughout the world. I used latitude (distance from the equator) of each city and copmpared it with Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed data via scatter plots. I then performed a linear regression on these plots to discover any correlations between latitude and weather conditions. This work is found in the "WeatherPy.ipynb" file which is located in the "WeatherPy" folder. The only strong correlation found was that between Temperature and Latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. As Latitude increased (traveling north of the equator), Temperature dropped. 

The second segment, VacationPy, utilized data from the WeatherPy analysis to plan for future vacations. The WeatherPy data frame was filtered to find cities with ideal weather conditions (Temperature: 70-81 degrees f; Wind Speed: <10 mph; Cloudiness = 0). Then, a hotel was searched for in all of the ideal weather cities. Unfortunately, this search proved unsuccesful due to issues with the code. However, all the ideal weather cities were plotted on a map for future vacation consideration! This work is found in the "VacationPy.ipynb" file located in the "VacationPy folder.
